# ðŸ§ª Examples

This document provides examples of how to use the MCP-X. It includes instructions on how to run the example services and how to interact with the server.

## Running the Examples

The examples are located in the `proto/examples` directory. Each example includes a server that can be run to demonstrate how to use MCP-X with a different type of service.

### Calculator Example

The calculator example demonstrates how to use MCP-X with a gRPC service.

1.  **Start the main server:**
    ```bash
    make server
    ```

2.  **Start the example calculator server:**
    In a new terminal window, run the following command:
    ```bash
    go run tests/e2e/calculator/cmd/server/main.go
    ```

### User Service Example

The user service example demonstrates how to use MCP-X with a gRPC service that uses gRPC reflection.

1.  **Start the main server:**
    ```bash
    make server
    ```

2.  **Start the example user service server:**
    In a new terminal window, run the following command:
    ```bash
    go run proto/examples/userservice/v1/server/main.go
    ```

## Interacting with the Server

You can interact with the MCP-X server using any gRPC client. The following examples use `grpcurl`.

### List Tools

To list the available tools, run the following command:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:8080 mcpx.mcp_router.v1.McpRouter/ListTools
```

### Execute a Tool

To execute a tool, you need to know the tool's name and the required inputs. For example, to use the `Add` tool from the calculator example, you would run the following command:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"tool_id": "calculator/Add", "inputs": {"a": 1, "b": 2}}' localhost:8080 mcpx.mcp_router.v1.McpRouter/ExecuteTool
