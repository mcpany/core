# Strategic Vision: MCP Any

## Mission Statement
MCP Any aims to be the indispensable core infrastructure layer for all AI agents, subagents, and swarms. It provides a universal adapter and gateway that standardizes how agents interact with tools, manage context, and enforce security policies.

## Core Pillars
1. **Universal Connectivity**: Support any MCP server, any LLM, and any agent framework.
2. **Zero Trust Security**: Granular, capability-based access control for all tool calls.
3. **Context Persistence**: Shared state and context inheritance across agent swarms and execution environments.

### Focus: Standardized Context Inheritance & Multi-Env Bridging
**Context**: Today's research highlights a major gap in how subagents inherit parent context and how agents bridge the gap between cloud sandboxes (e.g., Anthropic's) and local tools.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Environment Bridging**: MCP Any will act as a "secure proxy" that synchronizes state between sandboxed environments and local execution.
- **Context Inheritance Protocol**: Implementing a recursive header standard that allows subagents to automatically inherit "intent-scoped" context without bloating the LLM window.
- **Zero-Knowledge Context**: Ensuring subagents only receive the minimal state required for their specific task, following the principle of least privilege.

### Focus: Standardizing Multi-Agent Coordination & Heterogeneous Transport
**Context**: Today's findings show that as agents become more specialized (OpenClaw's multi-agent refinement) and transport layers more varied (Claude's HTTP/Stdio mix), MCP Any must evolve from a simple proxy to a sophisticated coordination hub.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Coordination Hub Architecture**: Transitioning to a model where MCP Any manages "agent sessions" and "handoffs" between specialized subagents, ensuring state stability.
- **Unified Transport Layer**: Abstracting the complexity of different MCP transport types (FastMCP, Stdio, HTTP) into a single, high-performance gateway.
- **Discovery Automation**: Moving towards an "Auto-Discovery" first approach to eliminate the manual configuration friction observed in the Gemini and Claude ecosystems.

### Focus: On-Demand Tool Discovery & Supply Chain Integrity
**Context**: Recent breakthroughs in Claude Code (MCP Tool Search) and the "Clinejection" supply chain attack have shifted the landscape. Agents now need to handle thousands of tools without context pollution, and they must do so within a verified security perimeter.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Lazy-Discovery Architecture**: MCP Any will pivot from "pushing" all tool schemas to "serving" them on-demand via a high-performance similarity search middleware. This allows for virtually unlimited tool scaling.
- **Supply Chain Provenance**: Implementing "Attested Tooling" where every MCP server must provide a cryptographic signature of its origin and configuration, preventing rogue installations like those seen in the Cline incident.
- **Context-Aware Scoping**: Moving beyond simple capability tokens to "Intent-Aware" permissions, where a tool call is only allowed if it aligns with the high-level intent verified by the Policy Engine.

### Focus: Federated Agency & A2A Interoperability
**Context**: As agent ecosystems mature, the bottleneck is no longer "Model-to-Tool" (MCP) but "Agent-to-Agent" (A2A) and "Node-to-Node" (Federation). MCP Any must expand its scope to become the universal bus for all agentic communications.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **A2A Gateway Protocol**: MCP Any will implement a protocol-neutral bridge for A2A communication, allowing disparate agent frameworks (e.g., OpenClaw, AutoGen) to exchange state and tasks via a unified MCP-like interface.
- **Federated Tool Mesh**: Moving from a standalone server to a "Mesh" architecture where multiple MCP Any instances can peer and share resources across network boundaries, governed by global Zero-Trust policies.
- **Resource-Aware Intelligence**: Integrating cost and latency telemetry into the tool discovery process, allowing LLMs to perform "Economical Reasoning" when selecting tools.

### Focus: Safe-by-Default Infrastructure & A2A Mesh Maturity
**Context**: The "8,000 Exposed Servers" crisis and the "Clawdbot" incident have proven that "Ease of Use" cannot come at the cost of "Default Security." Simultaneously, the A2A protocol is maturing into the primary way agents coordinate.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Safe-by-Default Hardening**: MCP Any will move to a "Local-Only by Default" binding for all adapters and gateways. Remote access will require explicit, cryptographic multi-factor attestation.
- **A2A Mesh Residency**: Shifting from a "Bridge" to a "Resident" model where MCP Any is the native home for A2A state, allowing it to act as a "Stateful Buffer" between intermittent agent connections.
- **Provenance-First Discovery**: All tool discovery will prioritize "Attested" sources. Tools from unverified or "Shadow" sources will be quarantined by default, requiring manual policy override.

## Strategic Evolution: [2026-03-07]
### Focus: Secure Orchestration & Parallel Swarm Coordination
**Context**: The massive vulnerability spree in OpenClaw (Zip Slip, Localhost Trust Flaw) and the release of Claude Agent Teams highlight a critical architectural requirement: MCP Any must transition from a "Passive Tool Gateway" to an "Active Orchestration Guard."
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Secure Skill Isolation (Sandboxed Installation)**: To prevent OpenClaw-style path traversal, MCP Any will implement a "Virtual File System" layer for MCP server installations. No MCP server will be allowed to touch the host filesystem directly; all "local" installs will be directed into isolated, content-addressed storage (CAS) with strictly limited entry points.
- **Swarm Message Bus (A2A+)**: Expanding the A2A bridge to support "Parallel Team Messaging." MCP Any will provide a shared blackboard and message-passing interface that handles context partitioning, ensuring that parallel agents in a swarm can coordinate without state collisions or context leakage.
- **Metadata-Driven Policy Enforcement**: Leveraging the annotation standards emerging in Gemini CLI to implement "Attribute-Based Access Control" (ABAC). Security policies will no longer just be about "Tool X can run," but "Tool X can run only if it has the 'Safe-For-Swarm' annotation and the caller is in the 'Team Lead' role."
