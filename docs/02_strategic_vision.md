# Strategic Vision: MCP Any

## Mission Statement
MCP Any aims to be the indispensable core infrastructure layer for all AI agents, subagents, and swarms. It provides a universal adapter and gateway that standardizes how agents interact with tools, manage context, and enforce security policies.

## Core Pillars
1. **Universal Connectivity**: Support any MCP server, any LLM, and any agent framework.
2. **Zero Trust Security**: Granular, capability-based access control for all tool calls.
3. **Context Persistence**: Shared state and context inheritance across agent swarms and execution environments.

### Focus: Standardized Context Inheritance & Multi-Env Bridging
**Context**: Today's research highlights a major gap in how subagents inherit parent context and how agents bridge the gap between cloud sandboxes (e.g., Anthropic's) and local tools.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Environment Bridging**: MCP Any will act as a "secure proxy" that synchronizes state between sandboxed environments and local execution.
- **Context Inheritance Protocol**: Implementing a recursive header standard that allows subagents to automatically inherit "intent-scoped" context without bloating the LLM window.
- **Zero-Knowledge Context**: Ensuring subagents only receive the minimal state required for their specific task, following the principle of least privilege.

### Focus: Standardizing Multi-Agent Coordination & Heterogeneous Transport
**Context**: Today's findings show that as agents become more specialized (OpenClaw's multi-agent refinement) and transport layers more varied (Claude's HTTP/Stdio mix), MCP Any must evolve from a simple proxy to a sophisticated coordination hub.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Coordination Hub Architecture**: Transitioning to a model where MCP Any manages "agent sessions" and "handoffs" between specialized subagents, ensuring state stability.
- **Unified Transport Layer**: Abstracting the complexity of different MCP transport types (FastMCP, Stdio, HTTP) into a single, high-performance gateway.
- **Discovery Automation**: Moving towards an "Auto-Discovery" first approach to eliminate the manual configuration friction observed in the Gemini and Claude ecosystems.

## Strategic Evolution: [2026-02-25]
### Focus: On-Demand Tool Discovery & Supply Chain Integrity
**Context**: Recent breakthroughs in Claude Code (MCP Tool Search) and the "Clinejection" supply chain attack have shifted the landscape. Agents now need to handle thousands of tools without context pollution, and they must do so within a verified security perimeter.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Lazy-Discovery Architecture**: MCP Any will pivot from "pushing" all tool schemas to "serving" them on-demand via a high-performance similarity search middleware. This allows for virtually unlimited tool scaling.
- **Supply Chain Provenance**: Implementing "Attested Tooling" where every MCP server must provide a cryptographic signature of its origin and configuration, preventing rogue installations like those seen in the Cline incident.
- **Context-Aware Scoping**: Moving beyond simple capability tokens to "Intent-Aware" permissions, where a tool call is only allowed if it aligns with the high-level intent verified by the Policy Engine.

### Focus: Hardened Command Execution & Swarm-Scale Accountability
**Context**: The emergence of critical RCEs (CVE-2026-0755, CVE-2026-0757) targeting `execAsync` and unvalidated MCP inputs, combined with the rise of massive 100-agent swarms (Kimi K2.5), demands a shift toward active execution hardening.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Secure Execution Gateway (SEG)**: MCP Any will intercept all tool calls involving shell commands or system execution, applying a "Deny-by-Default" regex and argument-sanitization layer.
- **Swarm Accountability Ledger**: Transitioning from simple logs to a structured "Accountability Ledger" that maps every tool call to a specific sub-agent, its parent intent, and its cryptographic provenance.
- **Attestation-First Discovery**: Integrating the On-Demand Discovery system with the Supply Chain Integrity Guard to ensure that agents can only "discover" tools that have been cryptographically verified and meet the SEG standards.
