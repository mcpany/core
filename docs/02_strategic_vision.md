# Strategic Vision: MCP Any

## Mission Statement
MCP Any aims to be the indispensable core infrastructure layer for all AI agents, subagents, and swarms. It provides a universal adapter and gateway that standardizes how agents interact with tools, manage context, and enforce security policies.

## Core Pillars
1. **Universal Connectivity**: Support any MCP server, any LLM, and any agent framework.
2. **Zero Trust Security**: Granular, capability-based access control for all tool calls.
3. **Context Persistence**: Shared state and context inheritance across agent swarms and execution environments.

## Strategic Evolution: [2026-02-23]
### Focus: Standardized Context Inheritance & Multi-Env Bridging
**Context**: Today's research highlights a major gap in how subagents inherit parent context and how agents bridge the gap between cloud sandboxes (e.g., Anthropic's) and local tools.
**Strategic Pivot**:
- **Environment Bridging**: MCP Any will act as a "secure proxy" that synchronizes state between sandboxed environments and local execution.
- **Context Inheritance Protocol**: Implementing a recursive header standard that allows subagents to automatically inherit "intent-scoped" context without bloating the LLM window.
- **Zero-Knowledge Context**: Ensuring subagents only receive the minimal state required for their specific task, following the principle of least privilege.
