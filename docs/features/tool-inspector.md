# Tool Inspector

## Overview
The Tool Inspector is a new feature that allows developers and administrators to deeply inspect and test MCP tools directly from the Tools management page.

## Features
- **Schema Viewing**: View the full JSON schema of any tool to understand its input structure and validation rules.
- **Interactive Testing**: A dynamically generated form based on the tool's schema allows users to input arguments and execute the tool.
- **Result Visualization**: See the JSON output of the tool execution immediately.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the **Tools** page.
2. Locate the tool you wish to inspect.
3. Click the **Inspect** button on the right side of the row.
4. A sheet will open with two tabs:
   - **Test Tool**: Fill in arguments and click "Execute".
   - **Schema Definition**: View the raw JSON schema.
