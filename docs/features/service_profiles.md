# Service Profiles

Service Profiles allow you to define different sets of enabled services and policies for different environments or user groups.

## Key Capabilities

- **Environment Isolation**: distinct profiles for `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`.
- **User Segmentation**: different profiles for `admin`, `user`, or `guest`.
- **Policy Overrides**: Apply different rate limits or access controls per profile.

For detailed usage and configuration, see [Profiles and Policies](../../server/docs/features/profiles_and_policies/README.md).
