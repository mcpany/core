# Message Bus Integration (NATS / Kafka)

MCP Any supports integrating with message buses to enable asynchronous communication and event-driven architectures. This allows the server to consume messages and trigger tools, or publish events based on tool execution.

## Supported Protocols

- **[NATS](../../server/docs/features/nats.md)**: High-performance messaging system.
- **[Kafka](../../server/docs/features/kafka.md)**: Distributed event streaming platform.

See the linked documents for configuration examples and usage patterns.
