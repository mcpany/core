# Mobile View Feature

I have implemented mobile responsiveness improvements for the MCP Any dashboard.

## Features

1. **Network Graph Mobile Mode**
   - The control card is now collapsible to save screen space.
   - The controls are positioned to be accessible on smaller screens.
   - The node details sheet now takes full width on mobile.

2. **Log Stream Mobile Layout**
   - Header controls are stacked to fit narrow screens.
   - A dedicated Play/Pause button is available for easier access.
   - Log rows are adjusted for readability.

3. **Secret Manager Mobile Layout**
   - The table is now horizontally scrollable.
   - The "Add Secret" dialog inputs are stacked for better usability.
