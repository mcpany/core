# üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This document outlines the current status and future direction of the MCP-X project.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features

The following features are fully implemented and tested:

-   **Service Types**:
    -   gRPC (with reflection)
    -   HTTP
    -   OpenAPI
    -   Stdio
    -   MCP-to-MCP Proxy
-   **Upstream Authentication**:
    -   API Key
    -   Bearer Token
-   **Dynamic Registration**: Services can be registered at runtime via the gRPC Registration API.
-   **Static Registration**: Services can be registered at startup via a YAML or JSON configuration file.

### Configured but Not Yet Implemented

The following features are defined in the configuration schema (`proto/config/v1/config.proto`) but are **not yet implemented** in the server logic:

-   **Advanced Service Policies**:
    -   Caching (`CacheConfig`)
    -   Rate Limiting (`RateLimitConfig`)
    -   Resilience (Circuit Breakers & Retries) (`ResilienceConfig`)
-   **Advanced Authentication**:
    -   OAuth 2.0 (`OAuth2Auth`)
    -   Incoming request authentication (`AuthenticationConfig`)
-   **Service Health Checks**:
    -   `HttpHealthCheck`
    -   `GrpcHealthCheck`
    -   `StdioHealthCheck`

For a complete list of all available configuration options, please see the [Configuration Reference](./reference/configuration.md).

## Short-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Months)

Our immediate focus is on implementing the features that are already defined in the configuration schema.

-   [ ] **Implement Advanced Service Policies**: Build the server-side logic to enforce the `CacheConfig`, `RateLimitConfig`, and `ResilienceConfig` policies.
-   [ ] **Implement Health Checking**: Build the logic for performing service health checks and routing traffic accordingly.
-   [ ] **Implement Advanced Authentication**: Add support for OAuth 2.0 and incoming request authentication.
-   [ ] **Expand Test Coverage**: Increase unit and integration test coverage for all existing and new features.
-   [ ] **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and provide more context for debugging.

## Long-Term Goals (6-12+ Months)

-   [ ] **Add Support for More Service Types**: Extend the server to support additional protocols, such as GraphQL and WebSockets.
-   [ ] **Implement a Web-Based UI**: Create a user interface for easier management and monitoring of the server.
-   [ ] **Official Helm Chart**: Provide an official Helm chart for easy deployment to Kubernetes.
-   [ ] **Distributed Tracing**: Integrate with systems like OpenTelemetry to provide better observability.
