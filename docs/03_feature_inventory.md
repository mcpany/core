## Evolution: [2026-02-28] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **"Safe-by-Default" Network Hardening**: (P0) Transition to local-only default bindings for all services. Requires explicit MFA/Attestation for remote exposure.
- **A2A Stateful Residency (Stateful Buffer)**: (P0) MCP Any acts as a persistent mailbox for A2A messages, enabling reliable communication between agents with intermittent connectivity.
- **Provenance-First Discovery (Attested Discovery)**: (P1) Automatic filtering of MCP servers based on cryptographic signatures and community reputation scores.

## Evolution: [2026-03-09] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Project Configuration Security Guard**: (P0) Validating proxy for project-local agent configurations (e.g., `.claude/settings.json`) to prevent RCE via malicious hooks.
- **Agent-Aware Blackboard Isolation**: (P0) Implements row-level security for the Shared KV Store, ensuring agents can only access state within their assigned "Intent Scope."
- **Detached Sandbox for Automated Hooks**: (P1) Isolated execution environment for automated tool sequences, preventing unauthorized host access.

### Priority Shifts
- **Shared KV Store (Blackboard)**: Re-affirmed as **P0** with new mandatory security isolation requirements.
- **Policy Firewall**: Promoted to **P0** (Already P0, but expanded to include "Project-Local Config Validation").

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Unvalidated Project-Local Configs**: Monitoring for total deprecation. All local configs must be attested via MCP Any before ingestion by agents.

## Evolution: [2026-03-10] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Sandbox-as-a-Service for Config Hooks**: (P0) A natively managed, ultra-lightweight execution environment for approved hooks found in project-local settings.
- **Project Configuration Drift Detection**: (P1) Background monitor that alerts the user if a project-local configuration file is modified (e.g., via `git pull`), requiring re-attestation of any hooks.
- **Intent-Bound Context Isolation**: (P0) Cryptographic enforcement that prevents subagents from accessing state or tools outside their explicitly assigned "Intent-Scope."

### Priority Shifts
- **Detached Sandbox for Automated Hooks**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. Urgent requirement to mitigate RCE vulnerabilities discovered in the ecosystem.
- **A2A Interop Bridge**: Re-affirmed as **P0** to support secure state handoffs in multi-agent swarms.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Implicit Hook Execution**: All "hooks" or "auto-exec" commands in configurations are now **Deprecated**. They must be explicitly moved to an "Attested Hooks" registry.

## Evolution: [2026-03-14] Updates
