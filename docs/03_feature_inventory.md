# Feature Inventory: MCP Any

## Current Backlog (P0/P1)
- **Policy Firewall**: Rego/CEL based hooking for tool calls.
- **HITL Middleware**: Suspension protocol for user approval flows.
- **Recursive Context Protocol**: Standardized headers for subagent inheritance.
- **Shared KV Store**: Embedded SQLite "Blackboard" tool for agents.

## Evolution: [2026-02-23] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Environment Bridging Middleware**: (P1) Bridge between cloud-sandboxed agents (e.g., Claude Code Sandbox) and local MCP Any tools. Enables seamless state transfer.
- **Machine-Checkable Security Contracts**: (P1) Declarative security models for tools that can be verified by automated agents (inspired by OpenClaw).
- **Zero-Trust Subagent Scoping**: (P0) Capability-based tokens that restrict subagents to a specific "intent-scope" of a parent's permissions.

### Priority Shifts
- **Recursive Context Protocol**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. Essential for modern agent swarms to prevent state loss.
- **Shared KV Store**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. Critical for coordinating multi-agent actions in complex workflows.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- *None today.*

## Evolution: [2026-02-24] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Session Management**: (P0) A session-aware middleware that tracks tool state and handoffs between multiple specialized agents.
- **Unified MCP Discovery Service**: (P1) Automated discovery and registry for local and remote MCP servers (Stdio, HTTP, FastMCP).
- **Session-Bound State Persistence**: (P1) Ensuring that multi-agent "long-running" tasks maintain state across tool calls and agent switches.

### Priority Shifts
- **Policy Firewall**: Promoted to **P0** to support secure "Zero Trust" subagent isolation as ecosystems become more complex.

## Evolution: [2026-02-25] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **On-Demand Discovery Middleware (Lazy-MCP)**: (P0) Implements similarity-based tool searching to prevent context pollution. Essential for massive (100+) tool libraries.
- **MCP Provenance Attestation**: (P1) Cryptographic verification of MCP server origins to prevent "Clinejection"-style supply chain attacks.
- **Slash-Command Bridge for Gemini**: (P1) Automatic mapping of MCP prompts to native Gemini CLI slash commands.

### Priority Shifts
- **Environment Bridging Middleware**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. The need for secure "Local-to-Cloud" tool bridging is increasing with more agents running in remote sandboxes.
- **Supply Chain Integrity Guard**: (New entry but P0 priority) High urgency due to recent ecosystem exploits.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Upfront Tool Schema Pushing**: Monitoring for deprecation in favor of Lazy-Discovery.

## Evolution: [2026-02-26] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **A2A Interop Bridge (Pseudo-MCP)**: (P0) Allows agents to interact with other agent frameworks using the A2A protocol, exposed as standard MCP tools.
- **Federated MCP Node Peering**: (P1) Secure discovery and proxying of tools across distributed MCP Any instances.
- **Cost & Latency Telemetry Middleware**: (P1) Automatically injects performance metadata into tool schemas to enable resource-aware agent reasoning.

### Priority Shifts
- **MCP Provenance Attestation**: Promoted to **P0** as it is a prerequisite for secure Federated MCP peering.
- **Lazy-MCP Middleware**: Promoted to **P0** (Already P0, but re-affirming importance for Federated Tool Mesh).

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Static Tool Schemas**: Moving towards dynamic, metadata-rich schemas that include real-time performance metrics.

## Evolution: [2026-02-28] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **"Safe-by-Default" Network Hardening**: (P0) Transition to local-only default bindings for all services. Requires explicit MFA/Attestation for remote exposure.
- **A2A Stateful Residency (Stateful Buffer)**: (P0) MCP Any acts as a persistent mailbox for A2A messages, enabling reliable communication between agents with intermittent connectivity.
- **Provenance-First Discovery (Attested Discovery)**: (P1) Automatic filtering of MCP servers based on cryptographic signatures and community reputation scores.

### Priority Shifts
- **MCP Provenance Attestation**: Re-affirmed as **P0** to support Provenance-First Discovery.
- **A2A Interop Bridge**: Promoted to **P0** and expanded to include Stateful Residency features.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Public Default Bindings**: Deprecate `0.0.0.0` as a default listener for any adapter or gateway.

## Evolution: [2026-03-02] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Universal Browser Bridge (UBB)**: (P0) Standardized MCP interface for browser-use tools. Allows agents to share browser sessions securely.
- **A2A Attested Identity (AgentCert)**: (P1) X.509-based certificates for agent-to-agent communication, ensuring verifiable provenance and preventing session hijacking.
- **Context-Sparsity Engine**: (P1) Automatically prunes and summarizes tool schemas based on the active agent's intent-graph to minimize token bloat.

### Priority Shifts
- **"Safe-by-Default" Network Hardening**: (P0) High urgency given the documented "MCP Top 10" vulnerabilities and the rise in unauthenticated MCP server exploits.
- **Supply Chain Integrity Guard**: (P0) Essential for the "Provenance-First Discovery" model to prevent malicious tool injection via hijacked MCP servers.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Manual MCP Registry Addition**: Monitoring for deprecation in favor of the "Unified Discovery Service" and "Provenance-First Discovery."
