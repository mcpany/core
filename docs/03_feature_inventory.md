# Feature Inventory: MCP Any

## Current Backlog (P0/P1)
- **Policy Firewall**: Rego/CEL based hooking for tool calls.
- **HITL Middleware**: Suspension protocol for user approval flows.
- **Recursive Context Protocol**: Standardized headers for subagent inheritance.
- **Shared KV Store**: Embedded SQLite "Blackboard" tool for agents.

## Evolution: [2026-02-23] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Environment Bridging Middleware**: (P1) Bridge between cloud-sandboxed agents (e.g., Claude Code Sandbox) and local MCP Any tools. Enables seamless state transfer.
- **Machine-Checkable Security Contracts**: (P1) Declarative security models for tools that can be verified by automated agents (inspired by OpenClaw).
- **Zero-Trust Subagent Scoping**: (P0) Capability-based tokens that restrict subagents to a specific "intent-scope" of a parent's permissions.

### Priority Shifts
- **Recursive Context Protocol**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. Essential for modern agent swarms to prevent state loss.
- **Shared KV Store**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. Critical for coordinating multi-agent actions in complex workflows.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- *None today.*

## Evolution: [2026-02-24] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Session Management**: (P0) A session-aware middleware that tracks tool state and handoffs between multiple specialized agents.
- **Unified MCP Discovery Service**: (P1) Automated discovery and registry for local and remote MCP servers (Stdio, HTTP, FastMCP).
- **Session-Bound State Persistence**: (P1) Ensuring that multi-agent "long-running" tasks maintain state across tool calls and agent switches.

### Priority Shifts
- **Policy Firewall**: Promoted to **P0** to support secure "Zero Trust" subagent isolation as ecosystems become more complex.

## Evolution: [2026-02-25] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **On-Demand Discovery Middleware (Lazy-MCP)**: (P0) Implements similarity-based tool searching to prevent context pollution. Essential for massive (100+) tool libraries.
- **MCP Provenance Attestation**: (P1) Cryptographic verification of MCP server origins to prevent "Clinejection"-style supply chain attacks.
- **Slash-Command Bridge for Gemini**: (P1) Automatic mapping of MCP prompts to native Gemini CLI slash commands.

### Priority Shifts
- **Environment Bridging Middleware**: Promoted from **P1** to **P0**. The need for secure "Local-to-Cloud" tool bridging is increasing with more agents running in remote sandboxes.
- **Supply Chain Integrity Guard**: (New entry but P0 priority) High urgency due to recent ecosystem exploits.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Upfront Tool Schema Pushing**: Monitoring for deprecation in favor of Lazy-Discovery.

## Evolution: [2026-02-26] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **A2A Interop Bridge (Pseudo-MCP)**: (P0) Allows agents to interact with other agent frameworks using the A2A protocol, exposed as standard MCP tools.
- **Federated MCP Node Peering**: (P1) Secure discovery and proxying of tools across distributed MCP Any instances.
- **Cost & Latency Telemetry Middleware**: (P1) Automatically injects performance metadata into tool schemas to enable resource-aware agent reasoning.

### Priority Shifts
- **MCP Provenance Attestation**: Promoted to **P0** as it is a prerequisite for secure Federated MCP peering.
- **Lazy-MCP Middleware**: Promoted to **P0** (Already P0, but re-affirming importance for Federated Tool Mesh).

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Static Tool Schemas**: Moving towards dynamic, metadata-rich schemas that include real-time performance metrics.

## Evolution: [2026-02-27] Updates

### Proposed Additions
- **Sandboxed MCP Runtime (Docker/WASM)**: (P0) Executes MCP servers in isolated environments to prevent host-level exploits.
- **Config Trust & Admin Allowlisting**: (P0) Restricts execution of sensitive tool types to configurations that have been explicitly trusted or signed.
- **Agent Session API (Pseudo-MCP)**: (P1) A set of standardized tools (`session_list`, `session_send`) for inter-agent communication, mapping to A2A protocols.

### Priority Shifts
- **A2A Interop Bridge**: (P0) Re-affirming P0 status as it is now coupled with the standardized Session API.
- **Policy Firewall**: (P0) Elevated importance to handle "Sandboxed Runtime" orchestration and trust levels.

### Deprecations / Monitoring
- **Automatic Hook Execution**: Monitoring for removal. All hooks must move to the "Sandboxed Runtime" or require explicit admin approval.
