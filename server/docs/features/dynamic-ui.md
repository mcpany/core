# Dynamic UI

The Dynamic UI provides a comprehensive web-based interface for managing, monitoring, and debugging your MCP Any server.

## Overview

The Dynamic UI allows you to perform the following tasks without restarting the server:

-   **Service Management**: Add, edit, and remove upstream services (HTTP, gRPC, Filesystem, etc.).
-   **Network Topology**: Visualize the connections between MCP Any and your upstream services.
-   **Interactive Playground**: Test tools directly in the browser with auto-generated forms.
-   **Observability**: View real-time logs and metrics (QPS, Latency).
-   **Secrets Management**: Securely manage secrets used by your services.
-   **Configuration**: Update global settings, authentication profiles, and rate limits.

The source code for the Dynamic UI is located in the [`ui/`](../../../ui/) directory.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [UI README](../../../ui/README.md) for instructions on how to run and develop the UI.
