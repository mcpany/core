## 3. Codebase Health

### Critical Areas (Refactoring Needed)


3.  **Webhook "Prototype" Status (`server/cmd/webhooks`)**
    - **Issue**: The code appears experimental and lacks the robustness of the main server (error handling, config validation).
    - **Risk**: If used in production, it could become a single point of failure.
    - **Recommendation**: Graduate this to `server/pkg/sidecar/webhooks` with full test coverage.

### Warning Areas

1.  **UI Component Duplication**: Some UI components in `ui/src/components` seem to have overlapping responsibilities (e.g., multiple "detail" views). A UI component audit is recommended.
2.  **Test Coverage gaps**: While core logic is tested, cloud providers (S3/GCS) and some new UI features lack comprehensive integration tests.

### Healthy Areas

- **Core Middleware Pipeline**: The middleware architecture is robust and extensible.
- **Protocol Implementation**: `server/pkg/mcpserver` cleanly separates protocol details from business logic.
- **Documentation**: The project has excellent documentation coverage for most features.
