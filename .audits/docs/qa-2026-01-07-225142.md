# QA Audit Report - 2026-01-07

**Auditor**: Senior Technical Quality Analyst (Jules)
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Scope**: Documentation Audit & System Verification

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for verification:

1. `server/docs/features/documentation_generation.md`
2. `server/docs/feature_audit_2025-05-15.md`
3. `server/docs/introduction.md`
4. `server/docs/debugging.md`
5. `server/docs/features/dynamic-ui.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Step/Claim | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `server/docs/features/documentation_generation.md` | `mcpany config doc --config-paths ...` | **FAILED** | Command failed with `unknown flag: --config-paths`. Verified code uses `--config-path`. |
| `server/docs/feature_audit_2025-05-15.md` | UI Overhaul features (Dashboard, Services, etc.) implemented | **PASSED** | Source code exists in `ui/src/app/` for all claimed features. |
| `server/docs/introduction.md` | Example config `wttr.in/config.yaml` exists | **PASSED** | File found at `server/examples/popular_services/wttr.in/config.yaml`. |
| `server/docs/debugging.md` | Debug mode enabled via `--debug` or `MCPANY_DEBUG` | **PASSED** | Code in `server/cmd/server/main.go` and `server/pkg/config` implements this logic. |
| `server/docs/features/dynamic-ui.md` | Dynamic UI source code in `ui/` | **PASSED** | Directory `ui/` exists and contains React application code. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
- **`server/docs/features/documentation_generation.md`**: Corrected the command flag from `--config-paths` (plural) to `--config-path` (singular) to match the actual CLI implementation.

### Code Implementations
- No code changes were required as no critical missing features (claimed by the audited documents) were found.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

- **Alignment Check**: The codebase is largely aligned with the "Implemented Features" section of the Roadmap.
- **Gaps Identified**: The Roadmap lists "Doctor API" and "Agent Debugger" as missing features. These were not addressed in this audit cycle as they were not claimed to be implemented by the selected documentation, but they remain open items for future sprints.
- **Cleanup**: Pre-existing audit reports older than 7 days were checked (none found to delete).
