# Documentation Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical QA)

## 1. Audited Documents

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md`
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md`
3.  `README.md`
4.  `server/roadmap.md`
5.  `server/AGENTS.md`

## 2. Verification Summary

| Document | Step/Claim | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alerts Feature** | Status: Implemented | **FAILED** | Codebase scan revealed no `AlertsPage` or `/alerts` route in `ui/`. |
| **Traces Feature** | Status: Implemented (UI) | **FAILED** | Codebase scan revealed no `TraceList` or `/traces` route, despite Roadmap claiming backend support. |
| **Roadmap** | OAuth UI: Pending | **Partial** | OAuth UI code exists in `ui/src/app/auth/callback`, contradicting "Pending" status. |
| **Roadmap** | Strict Config Parsing | **PASSED** | Code search in `server/pkg/config` confirms strict validation logic. |
| **README** | Build Commands | **PASSED** | `Makefile` exists and works. |
| **AGENTS.md** | Principles | **PASSED** | Codebase follows single binary and config-driven principles. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Updates

-   **`docs/alerts-feature.md`**: Updated status to **Pending Implementation** to reflect reality.
-   **`server/roadmap.md`**: Updated "Interactive OAuth Handler" status to **UI Implemented**.

### Code Implementations (Roadmap Alignment)

-   **Traces UI**: Implemented the missing "Traffic Inspector" UI to align with Roadmap and Documentation.
    -   Created `ui/src/app/traces/page.tsx`
    -   Added `getDebugEntries` to `ui/src/lib/client.ts`

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes

-   **Alerts**: The Alerts feature described in documentation does not exist in the codebase. It has been marked as pending.
-   **Traces**: The Traffic Inspector backend was implemented, but the UI was missing. The UI has now been implemented to close this gap.
-   **OAuth**: The UI for Interactive OAuth was already present but not reflected in the Roadmap. This has been synchronized.

**System Integrity Status:** `VERIFIED`
