## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Updates
- **`docs/features/tracing/README.md`**: Updated to reflect support for OTLP tracing configuration (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).

### Code Remediation
- **`pkg/telemetry/tracing.go`**: Added support for OTLP HTTP exporter (`otlptracehttp`). It now checks `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp`.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

- **OTLP Exporter Support (Rank 1)**: Addressed and implemented. This aligns with the "High Priority" and "Top 10 Recommended" items in the Product Evolution Plan.
- **Webhooks (Rank 8)**: Confirmed as implemented, although the Roadmap marked it as "Not yet implemented" in the Top 10 list. The basic `pre_call_hooks` and `post_call_hooks` described in docs are present in code.
