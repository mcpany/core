# Documentation Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Auditor:** Jules (AI Agent)

## 1. Scope
This audit report covers the verification of 5 randomly selected documentation files from the `docs/` directory. The goal was to ensure accuracy, verify functional integrity against the codebase, and align with the project roadmap.

## 2. Selected Documents

1.  `docs/features/auth.md`
2.  `docs/features/service_types.md`
3.  `docs/features/policies.md`
4.  `docs/features/transformation.md`
5.  `docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md`

## 3. Verification Results

| Document | Feature / Claim | Status | Evidence / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`docs/features/auth.md`** | mTLS Support | **Verified** | Verified `UpstreamMTLSAuth` in proto and logic in `http_pool.go` / `grpc_pool.go` to load certificates. `UpstreamAuthenticator` interface returns `nil` for mTLS, which is correct as it's connection-level. |
| | RBAC Middleware | **Verified** | Verified `server/pkg/middleware/rbac.go` exists and matches usage example. |
| **`docs/features/service_types.md`** | Supported Types | **Verified** | Verified existence of packages in `server/pkg/upstream/` for gRPC, HTTP, OpenAPI, GraphQL, Stdio, MCP, WebSocket, WebRTC, SQL. |
| **`docs/features/policies.md`** | Caching, Rate Limit, Resilience | **Verified** | Verified `server/pkg/middleware/` and `server/pkg/resilience/` implementations. |
| **`docs/features/transformation.md`** | JQ, Go Template, Regex | **Verified** | Verified `server/pkg/transformer/` implementation of `Transformer` (Template) and `TextParser` (JSONPath, XPath, Regex, JQ). |
| **`docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md`** | Dashboard | **Verified** | Verified `ui/src/app/page.tsx` uses `MetricsOverview` and `ServiceHealthWidget`. |
| | Service Management | **Verified** | Verified `ui/src/app/services/page.tsx` implements listing, toggling, and quick edit sheet. |
| | Middleware & Webhooks | **Verified** | Verified settings pages in `ui/src/app/settings/`. |

## 4. Alignment & Remediation

### Roadmap Check
*   **mTLS**: While not explicitly listed in the "Implemented Features" summary of the Roadmap, it is a supported feature in the code and documentation.
*   **Admin API**: The Roadmap mentions "Admin Management API: Partial". `docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md` implies management capabilities. The code in `server/pkg/admin/server.go` implements `ListServices`, `GetService`, `ListTools`, `GetTool`, `ClearCache`. It does **not** yet implement Create/Update/Delete for services directly via gRPC/Proto API in that file, but the UI uses `/api/services` (Next.js API route) which likely bridges to a management interface or edits config. The audit confirms the "Partial" status is accurate regarding the backend gRPC API, but the UI offers management features.

### Changes Made
No changes were necessary. The documentation was found to be accurate and aligned with the current codebase.

### Security Note
All sensitive information has been excluded from this report.
