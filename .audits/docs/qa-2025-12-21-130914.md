# Documentation Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Auditor:** Senior Technical Quality Analyst

## 1. Executive Summary

Performed a rigorous documentation audit and system integrity verification. Verified 5 randomly selected documents against the codebase and roadmap.

## 2. Audited Documents

1. `docs/features/service_types.md`
2. `docs/features/auth.md`
3. `docs/features/policies.md`
4. `docs/features/security.md`
5. `docs/features/observability.md`

## 3. Verification Details

| Document | Step/Feature | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/features/service_types.md` | SQL Service Type (Beta) | Verified | Code exists in `server/pkg/upstream/sql` and includes tests (`upstream_test.go`). |
| `docs/features/auth.md` | API Key, Bearer, OAuth 2.0 | Verified | Implemented in `server/pkg/config` and `server/pkg/middleware` (e.g., `auth.go`). |
| `docs/features/policies.md` | Caching, Rate Limit, Resilience | Verified | Implemented in `server/pkg/middleware` (Cache, RateLimit) and `server/pkg/resilience` (CircuitBreaker, Retry). |
| `docs/features/security.md` | Secrets, IP Allowlist, Webhooks | Verified | Implemented in `server/pkg/util/secrets.go`, `server/pkg/middleware/ip_allowlist.go`, and `server/pkg/tool/hooks.go`. |
| `docs/features/observability.md` | Tracing, Metrics, Logging | Verified | Implemented in `server/pkg/telemetry`, `server/pkg/metrics`, `server/pkg/logging`. |

## 4. Changes Made

### Documentation Updates

- Updated `docs/roadmap.md`: Moved "Structured Output Transformation (JQ/JSONPath)" from "Upcoming Features" to "Implemented Features" as verification confirmed the existence of `server/pkg/transformer/parser.go` which implements JQ and JSONPath support.

### Code Remediation

- No code changes were required as the verified features were present and the missing features (RBAC, Dynamic Web UI) were correctly identified as "Planned" in the Roadmap.

## 5. Roadmap Alignment

The documentation is largely aligned with the roadmap and the codebase, with the exception of the Transformation feature which was implemented but not updated in the roadmap document.

## 6. Security Note

This report has been scrubbed of all sensitive information.
