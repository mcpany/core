# QA Audit Report - 2026-01-21

**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Scope:** Documentation Audit & System Verification

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for detailed verification:

1. `server/docs/features/health-checks.md`
2. `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md`
3. `server/docs/features/caching/README.md`
4. `server/docs/features/audit_logging.md`
5. `ui/docs/features/dashboard.md`

## 2. Verification Findings

| Document | Feature / Step | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `health-checks.md` | Filesystem Health Check | ✅ Verified | Code in `server/pkg/health/health.go` implements filesystem check using `os.Stat` on root paths. |
| `rate-limiting/README.md` | Strategy Pattern | ✅ Verified | Code in `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go` uses `RateLimitStrategy` interface and strategies map. |
| `caching/README.md` | In-Memory Cache | ✅ Verified | Code in `server/pkg/middleware/cache.go` uses `gocache` with in-memory store. Tiered caching is correctly absent from code. |
| `audit_logging.md` | Webhook Storage | ✅ Verified | Code in `server/pkg/middleware/audit_webhook.go` implements webhook storage with configured timeout. |
| `dashboard.md` | Drill Down Feature | ❌ Discrepancy | Documentation claimed clicking KPI cards navigates to logs/traces ("Drill Down"), but `MetricsOverview` component has no click handlers. |

## 3. Changes Implemented

### Documentation Remediation
- **File:** `ui/docs/features/dashboard.md`
- **Action:** Updated documentation to remove the incorrect "Drill Down" section.
- **Reasoning:** The feature is not currently implemented in the UI. Documentation was aligned to match the actual system behavior (Scenario A).

### Code Remediation & Roadmap Alignment
- **Feature:** Upstream Latency Metrics (Roadmap Rank 45)
- **File:** `server/pkg/health/health.go`
- **Action:** Implemented latency recording for health checks.
- **Details:** Wrapped the health check function to measure execution duration and record it to the `mcp_any_health_check_status` metric (and new latency metric).
- **Roadmap Context:** This addresses Roadmap item Rank 45: "Upstream Latency Metrics: Record the latency of the initial connectivity probe to help diagnose slow upstream services".

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes

- **Health Checks:** The system is aligned with the roadmap. The "Filesystem Health Check" (Rank 15) is implemented.
- **Caching:** The system is aligned with the roadmap. "Advanced Tiered Caching" (Rank 10) is a planned feature and is correctly not present in the current codebase or documentation.
- **Rate Limiting:** The documentation correctly reflects the refactored Strategy Pattern.

## 5. Security & Compliance

- No sensitive information (API keys, secrets, PII) was found in the documentation or logs during this audit.
- The audit report itself has been scrubbed of any potential secrets.
