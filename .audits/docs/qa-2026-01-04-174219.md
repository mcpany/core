# Documentation Audit & Verification Report
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were selected for verification:

1.  `docs/features/health-checks.md`
2.  `docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md`
3.  `docs/features/admin_api.md`
4.  `docs/features/hot_reload.md`
5.  `docs/mobile-view.md`

## 2. Verification Details

| Document | Feature / Step | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Health Checks** | `upstream_services` config with `health_check` (HTTP, gRPC, etc.) | **Pass** | Verified Proto definitions in `proto/config/v1/health_check.proto` and usage in `server/pkg/health/`. |
| **Rate Limiting** | `rate_limit` block, Redis/Memory storage, Token Bucket | **Pass** | Verified `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go` and passed unit tests (`go test ./server/pkg/middleware/...`). |
| **Admin API** | `/v1/services/register` and gRPC `RegistrationService` | **Pass** | Verified `proto/api/v1/registration.proto` and `registration.pb.gw.go` mapping. |
| **Hot Reload** | File watcher using `fsnotify` | **Pass** | Verified usage of `fsnotify` in `server/pkg/config/watcher.go`. |
| **Mobile View** | Collapsible Network Graph control, Full-width Sheet on mobile | **Pass (with Doc Fix)** | Verified `ui/src/components/network/network-graph-client.tsx` implements `useIsMobile` and responsive classes. **Fixed** missing images in doc. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation
*   **`docs/mobile-view.md`**: Removed references to missing image files (`mobile_network.png`, etc.) which were causing broken links. Replaced with a placeholder note.

### Code
*   No code changes were required as the audited features were found to be correctly implemented and aligned with the current documentation.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes
*   **Rate Limiting**: The roadmap suggests refactoring `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go` due to complexity. Current implementation is functional but indeed mixes Redis and Local logic in one package (though separated in files). No functional gap found.
*   **SSO Integration**: This is a high-priority missing feature in the Roadmap. The `docs/features/admin_api.md` correctly does not claim SSO is implemented.
*   **Mobile View**: The implementation in `ui/` aligns with the description in `docs/mobile-view.md`.

## 5. Security & Hygiene
*   Deleted 1 old report (`.audits/docs/qa-2025-12-28-011517.md`) from a previous week.
*   No secrets or PII detected in this report.
