# QA Audit Report: Documentation & System Integrity
**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Auditor**: Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Audit Scope
The following 5 documents were randomly selected for verification:
1. `ui/docs/api-key-manager.md`
2. `ui/docs/log-stream.md`
3. `server/docs/caching.md` (and linked `server/docs/features/caching/README.md`)
4. `server/docs/prompt_workbench.md`
5. `server/docs/debugging.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Verification Step | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ui/docs/api-key-manager.md` | Check "Secrets & Keys" UI and "Add Secret" flow. | **Partial Discrepancy** | UI exists and functions as described. Doc claimed "local storage" simulation, but code uses "in-memory mock storage" on Next.js server (`ui/src/lib/server/secrets-store.ts`). |
| `ui/docs/log-stream.md` | Verify Log Stream UI and simulated data. | **Verified** | `ui/src/components/logs/log-stream.tsx` implements the UI with mocked data generation as described. |
| `server/docs/features/caching/README.md` | Verify `cache` config (`is_enabled`, `ttl`) and run E2E test. | **Verified (Config) / Failed (Test)** | Config structure in `proto/config/v1/call.proto` matches doc. E2E test `TestCachingE2E` failed due to missing `weather-server` binary in build environment. |
| `server/docs/prompt_workbench.md` | Verify Prompt Workbench UI and mock execution. | **Verified** | `ui/src/components/prompts/prompt-workbench.tsx` and `ui/src/lib/client.ts` implement the feature with fallback mock simulation as described. |
| `server/docs/debugging.md` | Verify `--debug` flag and `MCPANY_DEBUG` env var. | **Verified** | `server/pkg/config/config.go` binds the flag and env var correctly. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation
- **`ui/docs/api-key-manager.md`**: Updated the description of the secure storage simulation to accurately reflect the in-memory mock implementation (server-side) instead of local storage (client-side).

### Code Remediation
- **None**: No code changes were required based on the selected documents. The Roadmap gap "Doctor API" was noted but not addressed as it was not covered by the selected documents.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment
- **Doctor API**: Missing (Required by Roadmap).
- **Agent Debugger**: "Debugging" doc covers basic logs; Roadmap requires full debugger.
- **Context Optimizer**: In progress.

## 5. Security Note
This report has been scrubbed of all sensitive information, API keys, and PII.
