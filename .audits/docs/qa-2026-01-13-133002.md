# QA Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Auditor:** Jules (AI Agent)

## 1. Environment Cleanup
- Deleted outdated report: `qa-2026-01-05-071413.md` (Older than 7 days).

## 2. Document Selection & Verification

| Document | Verification Status | Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | **Verified** | Accurately describes the feature. Confirmed usage of mock data as stated. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | **Verified** | Accurately describes the feature. Confirmed usage of mock API as stated, with backend readiness noted. |
| `server/docs/features/caching/README.md` | **Verified** | Confirmed configuration fields (`is_enabled`, `ttl`, `strategy`, `semantic_config`) match `proto/config/v1/call.proto`. |
| `server/docs/features/monitoring/README.md` | **Correction Applied** | **Discrepancy:** Metric names in code differed from docs (`latency_seconds` vs `latency`) and some were missing. **Action:** Updated documentation to match `server/pkg/middleware/tool_metrics.go`. |
| `server/docs/developer_guide.md` | **Verified** | Confirmed `make prepare` works (via `Makefile` delegation or shim) and matches guide. |

## 3. Alignment & Code Remediation

### Roadmap Analysis
- **Service Templates Library (`ui/roadmap.md`)**:
    - Status: `[x]` (Completed).
    - **Verification**: Confirmed implementation in `ui/src/app/marketplace/page.tsx` (Local Templates) and `instantiate-dialog.tsx`. No action needed.

### Changes Made
1.  **Documentation Update (`server/docs/features/monitoring/README.md`)**:
    - Corrected `mcpany_tools_call_latency` to `mcpany_tools_call_latency_seconds`.
    - Removed non-existent metrics (`mcpany_tools_call_errors`, `mcpany_tools_list_total`, `mcpany_config_reload_total`).
    - Added missing metrics found in code (`mcpany_tools_call_input_bytes`, `mcpany_tools_call_output_bytes`, `mcpany_tools_call_tokens_total`, `mcpany_tools_call_in_flight`).
    - Added Protocol Metrics section (`mcpany_mcp_operation_...`).

## 4. Security
- No sensitive information (keys, secrets, PII) was found in the audited documents or included in this report.
