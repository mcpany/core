# QA Audit Report - 2026-01-22

**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Scope:** Documentation Audit & System Verification

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for detailed verification:

1. `docs/alerts-feature.md`
2. `server/docs/features/hot_reload.md`
3. `server/docs/features/security.md`
4. `ui/docs/features/playground.md`
5. `server/docs/features/prompts/README.md`

## 2. Verification Findings

| Document | Feature / Step | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Alerts Backend & Rules | ⚠️ Partial Gap | Backend CRUD exists, but Rule Evaluation logic is missing. Roadmap required Health Webhooks which were missing. |
| `server/docs/features/hot_reload.md` | Config Watching | ✅ Verified | `server/pkg/config/watcher.go` implements fsnotify and debounce logic. |
| `server/docs/features/security.md` | IP Allowlist | ✅ Verified | `server/pkg/middleware/ip_allowlist.go` implements logic. |
| `server/docs/features/security.md` | Secrets Management | ✅ Verified | `server/pkg/util/secrets.go` implements Vault, AWS Secrets, etc. |
| `ui/docs/features/playground.md` | Playground UI | ✅ Verified | `ui/src/app/playground` code exists and matches description. |
| `server/docs/features/prompts/README.md` | Prompts API | ✅ Verified | `server/pkg/mcpserver/server.go` handles `prompts/get`. |

## 3. Changes Implemented

### Documentation Remediation
- **File:** `docs/alerts-feature.md`
- **Action:** Added section "Health Webhooks" to describe the new capability.
- **Reasoning:** Aligned documentation with the newly implemented feature required by Roadmap.

### Code Remediation & Roadmap Alignment
- **Feature:** Health Webhooks (Roadmap Rank 46)
- **Files:**
    - `proto/config/v1/config.proto`
    - `server/pkg/health/health.go`
    - `server/pkg/app/server.go`
- **Action:** Implemented global webhook configuration for system health changes.
- **Details:** Added `AlertConfig` to `GlobalSettings`. Implemented `sendWebhook` in `health` package which triggers on status change. Updated `Application` to load this config.
- **Roadmap Context:** Addresses Rank 46: "Health Webhooks: Configure webhooks (Slack, Discord, PagerDuty) to be triggered when the system health status changes".

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes

- **Health Webhooks:** Now implemented (Rank 46).
- **Alerts:** The Rule Evaluation logic (Rank N/A but implied) is still a gap, but webhooks provide critical notification capability.
- **Security:** "Tool Poisoning Mitigation" (Rank 1) is still a high priority roadmap item to be addressed in future sprints.

## 5. Security & Compliance

- No sensitive information (API keys, secrets, PII) was found in the documentation or logs during this audit.
- The audit report itself has been scrubbed of any potential secrets.
