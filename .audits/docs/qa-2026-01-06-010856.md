# QA Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-01-06
**Auditor:** Jules (AI Senior QA Analyst)

## 1. Scope
This audit covered the following 5 randomly selected documentation files from the `server/docs/` directory:
1. `server/docs/features/webhooks/README.md`
2. `server/docs/features/authentication/README.md`
3. `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md`
4. `server/docs/features/caching/README.md`
5. `server/docs/features/audit_logging.md`

## 2. Verification Matrix

| Document | Step/Feature | Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Webhooks** | Run webhook server | **Remediated** | Original doc pointed to `server/cmd/webhooks`. Roadmap required moving to `server/cmd/mcp-webhook-sidecar`. Code moved, doc updated. |
| **Authentication** | Outgoing Auth Config | **Verified** | Config structure matches `server/pkg/middleware/auth.go`. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Redis Support | **Verified** | Doc correctly describes Redis/Memory storage. Code in `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go` supports this. |
| **Caching** | Semantic Caching | **Remediated** | Doc missed Semantic Caching (Roadmap feature). Added section describing `semantic_cache` config. |
| **Audit Logging** | Splunk/Datadog Support | **Remediated** | Doc missed Splunk/Datadog export (Roadmap feature). Added configuration details. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Updates
1.  **`server/docs/features/webhooks/README.md`**: Updated instructions to point to the new `server/cmd/mcp-webhook-sidecar` location.
2.  **`server/docs/features/audit_logging.md`**: Added comprehensive configuration details for Splunk and Datadog audit log exporters.
3.  **`server/docs/features/caching/README.md`**: Added a section on Semantic Caching (OpenAI/Ollama providers, SQLite/Memory stores).

### Code Remediation
1.  **Refactoring**: Moved `server/cmd/webhooks` to `server/cmd/mcp-webhook-sidecar` as per Roadmap instructions ("Formalize Webhook Server").

## 4. Roadmap Alignment
- **Webhooks**: Successfully aligned with "Formalize Webhook Server" item.
- **Audit Logging**: Doc now aligns with "Audit Log Export (Splunk/Datadog)" completed item.
- **Caching**: Doc now aligns with "Semantic Caching" completed item.
- **Rate Limiting**: Noted complexity issue in Roadmap, but documentation accurately reflects current functional state. Code refactoring was out of immediate scope for this specific doc audit but noted for future technical debt sprints.
