# QA Audit Report - 2026-01-18

**Auditor:** Senior Technical Quality Analyst (AI Agent)
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Time:** 01:16:52

## 1. Environment Cleanup

- **Action:** Deleted old report file.
- **File:** `.audits/docs/qa-2026-01-10-092411.md` (Older than 7 days).

## 2. Documents Audited

The following 5 documents were selected for recursive verification:

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md`
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md`
3.  `server/docs/caching.md` (referencing `server/docs/features/caching/README.md`)
4.  `server/docs/monitoring.md` (referencing `server/docs/features/monitoring/README.md`)
5.  `server/docs/developer_guide.md`

## 3. Verification Findings

| Document | Feature/Section | Verification Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Alerts & Incidents UI | **Partially Verified** | UI components exist in `ui/src/app/alerts`. However, implementation relies on static `MOCK_ALERTS` data, not a real backend. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Traffic Inspector UI | **Partially Verified** | UI components exist in `ui/src/app/traces`. Implementation relies on Mock API (`/api/traces`). Backend OpenTelemetry support exists but isn't connected to this UI yet. |
| `server/docs/features/caching/README.md` | Caching Middleware | **Verified** | `server/pkg/middleware/cache.go` implements caching logic. Metrics `mcpany_cache_hits`, etc. are correctly defined in code. |
| `server/docs/features/monitoring/README.md` | Prometheus Metrics | **Verified** | `server/pkg/middleware/tool_metrics.go` implements metrics. Metric names `mcpany_tools_call_total`, etc. match documentation. |
| `server/docs/developer_guide.md` | Dev Setup & Structure | **Verified** | `Makefile` contains `prepare`, `run`, `test` commands. Directory structure (`pkg/serviceregistry`, etc.) matches code. |

## 4. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation

-   **`docs/alerts-feature.md`**: Updated "Status" from "Implemented" to "UI Prototype (Mock Data)" to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.
-   **`docs/traces-feature.md`**: Added "Status: UI Prototype (Mock Data)" to the header to clarify that the UI visualization uses mock data, even though backend tracing support exists.

### Code Remediation

-   No code changes were required. The identified gaps (Alerts backend, Traces UI backend) are not critical requirements in the current `server/roadmap.md` (Top 10) or `ui/roadmap.md`. The existing "Prototype" status is acceptable for these features.

## 5. Roadmap Alignment

-   **Distributed Tracing**: The Roadmap lists "Distributed Tracing: OpenTelemetry support" as Implemented. This refers to the backend capability, which is present. The Traces UI being a prototype does not contradict the backend implementation status.
-   **Alerts**: The "Alerts & Incidents" feature is a "Premium Enterprise" feature that is currently in UI Prototype phase. It is not listed as a critical blocker in the current Roadmap.
-   **System Integrity**: Core features (Caching, Monitoring) are fully implemented and documented correctly.

## 6. Security & Secrets

-   This report contains no sensitive information, PII, API keys, or secrets.
