# Documentation Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were selected for verification:

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md` (Top Level Feature)
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md` (Top Level Feature)
3.  `server/docs/features/health-checks.md` (Server Feature)
4.  `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md` (Server Feature)
5.  `ui/docs/features/secrets.md` (UI Feature)

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Feature | Status | Verification Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Alerts & Incidents | **Outdated** | Backend API for Alerts CRUD exists (`handleAlerts`), but "Rule Management" described in doc is only a mock in UI (`CreateRuleDialog`) and missing in backend. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Traffic Inspector | **Verified** | Verified existence of `/debug/entries` endpoint in `server/pkg/app/server.go`. |
| `server/docs/features/health-checks.md` | Health Checks | **Verified** | Verified `filesystemCheck` in `server/pkg/health/health.go` implements automatic root path checking. |
| `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md` | Rate Limiting | **Verified** | Verified `COST_METRIC_TOKENS` support in `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go`. |
| `ui/docs/features/secrets.md` | Secrets Vault | **Verified** | Verified secret substitution logic `${secrets.KEY}` is handled in `server/pkg/config/secrets.go`. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Edits

-   **`docs/alerts-feature.md`**: Updated the "Key Capabilities" and "Status" sections.
    -   Downgraded "Rule Management" from a live capability to a "Planned Capability (Roadmap)".
    -   Clarified that the UI component for rules is currently a prototype.

### Code Remediation

-   No code changes were required as most features were correctly implemented. For Alerts, the documentation was adjusted to match the code reality (Roadmap Item #48 is partially implemented).

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

-   **Alerting System (#48)**: The current implementation provides the foundation (Alerts CRUD) but lacks the automated Rule Engine. The documentation now accurately reflects this "Active (Partial)" status.
-   **Filesystem Health Check (#15)**: The feature is fully implemented and correctly documented.

## 5. Security Notes

-   Report scrubbed of all sensitive information.
