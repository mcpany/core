# QA Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Audited Documents
The following 5 documents were selected for random audit:
1. `docs/features/service_types.md`
2. `docs/features/auth.md`
3. `docs/features/policies.md`
4. `docs/features/security.md`
5. `docs/features/observability.md`

## 2. Verification Table

| Document | Feature Claim | Verification Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `service_types.md` | gRPC, HTTP, OpenAPI, GraphQL, Stdio, MCP Proxy, WebSocket, WebRTC, SQL | **Verified** | All types present in `server/pkg/upstream/`. |
| `auth.md` | API Key, Bearer Token, OAuth 2.0, mTLS | **Verified** | Implemented in `server/pkg/auth` and consumed in `server/pkg/upstream/*`. |
| `policies.md` | Caching, Rate Limiting (Memory/Redis), Resilience | **Verified** | Found in `server/pkg/middleware` (Caching, RateLimit) and `server/pkg/resilience`. |
| `security.md` | Secrets Management, IP Allowlisting, Webhooks | **Verified** | Config loading handles secrets; `IPAllowlistMiddleware` exists; Webhooks logic present. |
| `observability.md` | Tracing, Metrics, Logging | **Verified** | `server/pkg/telemetry`, `server/pkg/metrics`, `server/pkg/logging` are robust. |

## 3. Gap Analysis & Remediation
**Context**: The `product-evolution-plan.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` identified "Admin Management API (CRUD)" as a High Priority / In Progress feature.

**Finding**:
*   `server/pkg/admin` implements Read-Only operations (`ListServices`, `GetService`, etc.) and `ClearCache`.
*   **Update**: It was identified that Service CRUD operations are already supported via the `RegistrationService` API (`/v1/services/register`, `/v1/services/unregister`).
*   Implementing these in `AdminService` would be redundant.

**Remediation Actions Taken**:
1.  **Roadmap Correction**: Updated `docs/roadmap.md` and `product-evolution-plan.md` to reflect that Service CRUD is available via the `RegistrationService`.
2.  **Cleanup**: Reverted initial attempts to duplicate this functionality in `AdminService` to maintain a single source of truth.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment
*   **Item**: Admin Management API (CRUD)
*   **Previous Status**: In Progress (Skeletal)
*   **Current Status**: **Implemented (via Registration API)**
*   **Note**: The "Dynamic Web UI" can consume the existing Registration API for service management.

## 5. Security & Hygiene
*   No sensitive information, PII, or secrets were found in the report.
*   Environment cleanup performed (no stale reports > 7 days found).
