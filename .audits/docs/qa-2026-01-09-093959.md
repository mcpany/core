# QA Audit Report

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Auditor**: Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Scope**: Documentation Audit, System Integrity Verification, Roadmap Alignment

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected and audited:

1.  `docs/traces-feature.md` (Request Tracer & Observability)
2.  `README.md` (Root README)
3.  `ui/README.md` (UI Documentation)
4.  `product-evolution-plan.md` (Roadmap)
5.  `server/AGENTS.md` (Agent Instructions)

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Step/Setting | Outcome | Evidence / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Mock API usage | **Verified** | Code uses `/api/traces` (mock) and `ResizablePanel`. Matches doc. |
| `README.md` | Roadmap Link | **Failed** | Link pointed to `server/docs/roadmap.md` (missing). Fixed to `product-evolution-plan.md`. |
| `ui/README.md` | Dev Port 9002 | **Verified** | `package.json` confirms `next dev -p 9002`. |
| `product-evolution-plan.md` | Implemented Features | **Verified** | "Agent Debugger" and "SSO Integration" code confirmed in `server/pkg`. |
| `server/AGENTS.md` | Docstring Coverage | **Failed** | `check_doc.go` reported missing docstrings in `compliance.go`, `context_optimizer.go`, `runtime.go`. Fixed. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
-   **`README.md`**: Updated the "Roadmap" link to point to the correct file (`product-evolution-plan.md`).

### Code Remediation
-   **`server/pkg/middleware/compliance.go`**: Added missing docstrings for `Header`, `WriteHeader`, and `Write` methods.
-   **`server/pkg/middleware/context_optimizer.go`**: Added missing docstrings for `Write` and `WriteString` methods.
-   **`server/pkg/wasm/runtime.go`**: Added missing docstrings for `Runtime` and `Plugin` interface methods (`LoadPlugin`, `Close`).

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

-   **Request Tracer**: The documentation (`docs/traces-feature.md`) correctly identifies the feature as using a "Mock API". This is consistent with the codebase. The Roadmap does not currently prioritize a full backend integration for this specific feature, so no "Major Feature Gap" was flagged requiring immediate code implementation.
-   **Agent Debugger & Inspector**: Confirmed as "Implemented" in Roadmap and present in `server/pkg/middleware/debugger.go`.
-   **SSO Integration**: Confirmed as "Implemented" in Roadmap and present in `server/pkg/auth`.

## 5. Security & Hygiene
-   **Scrubbing**: This report contains no PII, API keys, or secrets.
-   **Cleanup**: Scanned `.audits/docs/` for reports > 7 days old. None found.

**Status**: audit passed, remediation complete.
