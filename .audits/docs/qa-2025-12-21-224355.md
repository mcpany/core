# QA Audit Report: 2025-12-21

**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Date:** 2025-12-21

## 1. Scope
The following documents were selected for verification:
1.  `docs/features/service_types.md`
2.  `docs/features/auth.md`
3.  `docs/features/policies.md`
4.  `docs/features/web_ui.md`
5.  `docs/features/transformation.md`

## 2. Verification Summary

| Document | Verification Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/features/service_types.md` | **PASS** | All listed service types (gRPC, HTTP, OpenAPI, GraphQL, Stdio, MCP-to-MCP, WebSocket, WebRTC, SQL) are present in `server/pkg/upstream/`. |
| `docs/features/auth.md` | **PASS (with remediation)** | Auth methods (API Key, Bearer, OAuth, Basic, mTLS) verified. RBAC Middleware was missing (as noted in Roadmap) and was implemented. |
| `docs/features/policies.md` | **PASS** | Caching, Rate Limiting, and Resilience (Circuit Breaker, Retry) logic found in `server/pkg/middleware` and `server/pkg/resilience`. |
| `docs/features/web_ui.md` | **PASS** | UI exists in `ui/`. "Beta" status and "Playground Coming Soon" match current state. |
| `docs/features/transformation.md` | **PASS** | `server/pkg/transformer` implements Go Templates, JSONPath, JQ, XPath, and Regex. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
*   **`docs/features/auth.md`**: Updated to include the new unified RBAC Middleware information.

### Code Implementation
*   **Implemented `RBACMiddleware`**: Created `server/pkg/middleware/rbac.go` and `server/pkg/middleware/rbac_test.go` to fulfill the Roadmap requirement for a unified RBAC middleware.
    *   This middleware allows enforcing `RequireRole` and `RequireAnyRole` on HTTP handlers.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment
*   **RBAC Integration**: Addressed the "Unified RBAC Middleware" item.
*   **Interactive Playground**: Confirmed as "Coming Soon" in docs, consistent with Roadmap backlog.
*   **Admin API**: Confirmed partial implementation, consistent with Roadmap.
