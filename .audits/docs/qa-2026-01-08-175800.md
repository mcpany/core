# QA Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## Scope
- Directory: `docs/`
- Sample Size: 1 document (All available)
- Roadmap Alignment: `server/docs/roadmap.md`

## Audited Documents

### 1. `docs/traces-feature.md`

| Step/Feature | Verification Outcome | Evidence/Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Screenshot** | **Repaired** | Original link `.audit/ui/2025-05-23/trace_view.png` was broken. Generated new screenshot at `docs/images/trace_view.png`. |
| **Frontend Stack** | **Verified** | Verified `ui/` uses Next.js and `ResizablePanel` (`ui/src/app/traces/page.tsx`). |
| **Visualization** | **Verified** | Custom timeline exists in `TraceDetail` component. |
| **Mock API** | **Verified** | `ui/src/app/api/traces/route.ts` exists and implements mock data generation. |
| **Usage Flow** | **Verified** | Verified locally via Playwright that `/traces` page loads and shows list + details. |

## Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
- **`docs/traces-feature.md`**:
    - Updated screenshot link to point to newly generated image.
    - Clarified that while the frontend uses a mock API, the backend *does* support OpenTelemetry.

### Code Remediation
- **Missing Asset Generation**: Generated `docs/images/trace_view.png` to fix the broken documentation image.

## Roadmap Alignment
- **Feature**: `Distributed Tracing`
- **Roadmap Status**: Implemented (`[x] Distributed Tracing`).
- **Audit Findings**: The backend has `InitTracer` with OTLP support (`server/pkg/telemetry/tracing.go`). The frontend currently uses a Mock API. This partial alignment is noted in the updated documentation. The "Agent Debugger" (Rank 1 in Roadmap) is partially realized by this Traces feature.

## Summary
The system integrity is good. The backend capabilities for tracing exist, and the frontend has a functional (mock-backed) visualization. The documentation was slightly outdated regarding the screenshot and context of backend support, which has been corrected.
