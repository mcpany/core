# QA Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Scope:** Documentation Audit, System Integrity Verification, Roadmap Alignment

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for detailed audit:

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md`
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md`
3.  `README.md`
4.  `server/roadmap.md`
5.  `server/AGENTS.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Step / Claim | Verification Method | Outcome | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Route `/alerts` exists | Code Check | ✅ Verified | `ui/src/app/alerts/page.tsx` exists. |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Components (`AlertList`, etc.) exist | Code Check | ✅ Verified | Components present in `ui/src/components/alerts/`. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Route `/traces` & `/api/traces` | Code Check | ✅ Verified | Route and Mock API implementation confirmed. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Image `trace_view.png` exists | File Check | ✅ Verified | Image found in `docs/images/`. |
| `README.md` | Build commands (`make build/test`) | Execution/File Check | ✅ Verified | Makefile exists and targets are valid. |
| `server/roadmap.md` | "Interactive OAuth Handler" status | Code Check | ⚠️ Discrepancy | Roadmap stated "UI Pending", but UI code exists and is active. |
| `server/roadmap.md` | "Schema Validation Playground" | Code Check | ❌ Missing | Feature required by Roadmap (Rank 13) was missing. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation
*   **`server/roadmap.md`**: Updated the status of "Interactive OAuth Handler" and "Interactive OAuth UI" to reflect that the backend is implemented and the UI is implemented (no longer pending).

### Code Remediation (Roadmap Alignment)
*   **Feature Implementation**: Implemented **Schema Validation Playground** (Roadmap Item 13).
    *   Created `ui/src/app/validator/page.tsx`: A dedicated page for validating Upstream Service Configurations using the existing `apiClient.validateService`.
    *   Updated `ui/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`: Added "Schema Validator" to the Development menu in the sidebar.
*   **Roadmap Update**: Marked "Schema Validation Playground" as Implemented in `server/roadmap.md`.

### Environment Cleanup
*   Deleted outdated audit report: `.audits/docs/qa-2026-01-10-092411.md` (older than 7 days).

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes
*   The "Interactive OAuth" feature set is more advanced than the roadmap indicated. The UI components `register-service-dialog.tsx` and `step-auth.tsx` already include logic for initiating OAuth flows.
*   The "Schema Validation Playground" was identified as a "Low" difficulty but high-value DevX feature that was missing. It has now been added to the product.
*   The codebase is generally well-aligned with the roadmap, with many recent features (like "Strict Config Parsing") correctly marked as implemented.

## 5. Security & Hygiene
*   No secrets or PII were found in the generated report.
*   The audit report is saved to `.audits/docs/` with the required timestamp format.
