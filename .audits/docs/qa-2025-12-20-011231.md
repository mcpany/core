## Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
- **`docs/features/admin_api.md`**: Added `GetHealth` endpoint documentation to align with Roadmap and new implementation.

### Code Implementations
- **`proto/admin/v1/admin.proto`**: Added `GetHealth` RPC definition.
- **`pkg/admin/server.go`**: Implemented `GetHealth` method returning server status and service count.
- **`pkg/admin/server_test.go`**: Added unit test for `GetHealth`.

## Roadmap Alignment
- **Admin Management API**: Partially addressed. Added `GetHealth` endpoint. Configuration management (CRUD) still pending but infrastructure is ready.
