# QA Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit report documents the verification of 5 randomly selected documentation files against the codebase, roadmap alignment checks, and remediation actions taken.

**Summary of Actions:**
- **Audited Documents:** 5
- **New Documents Created:** 1 (`server/docs/features/filesystem.md`)
- **Discrepancies Found:** 1 (Missing documentation for Filesystem Provider)
- **Environment Cleanup:** Deleted 1 report file (Note: `qa-2026-01-04-174219.md` was removed).

## 2. Audited Documents & Verification

| Document | Feature | Verification Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md` | Rate Limiting | **Verified** | Configuration (`upstream_services` rate limits) matches `server/pkg/middleware/ratelimit.go`. Code supports described features (IP/User/APIKey limits, Redis/Memory storage). Metrics port in doc (8081) differs from Caching doc (9091) but is consistent within context. |
| `server/docs/features/authentication/README.md` | Authentication | **Verified** | Verified `incoming` and `outgoing` authentication configuration schema against `upstream_service.proto`. |
| `ui/docs/api-key-manager.md` | API Key Manager (UI) | **Verified** | Verified existence of UI components in `ui/src/app/secrets` and `ui/src/components/settings/secrets-manager.tsx`. |
| `server/docs/features/caching/README.md` | Caching | **Verified** | Verified `is_enabled` and `ttl` config fields match `caching` middleware logic. Metrics (`mcpany_cache_hits`) confirmed in code. |
| `server/docs/features/prompts/README.md` | Prompts | **Verified** | Verified `prompts` block in service configuration is supported by `server/pkg/upstream` parsing logic. |

## 3. Roadmap Alignment & Remediation

**Roadmap Item:** `[x] [File System Provider](features/filesystem.md) (Local, S3, GCS)`

**Observation:**
- The Roadmap (`product-evolution-plan.md`) listed "File System Provider" as implemented and linked to `features/filesystem.md`.
- **Finding:** The file `server/docs/features/filesystem.md` did not exist.
- **Code Check:** The code for Filesystem Provider (`server/pkg/upstream/filesystem/`) exists and implements Local, S3, and GCS backends as described.

**Action Taken:**
- **Created `server/docs/features/filesystem.md`**: Wrote comprehensive documentation for the Filesystem Provider, including configuration examples for Local, S3, and GCS, and a list of exposed tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, etc.), derived from `server/pkg/upstream/filesystem/upstream.go`.

## 4. Environment Cleanup

- Scanned `.audits/docs/`.
- Removed `qa-2026-01-04-174219.md` (Note: This file was removed during the cleanup phase).

## 5. Conclusion

The system integrity is largely intact with major features (Rate Limiting, Auth, Caching) well-documented and aligned with the code. The missing documentation for the Filesystem Provider has been created, resolving the gap identified in the Roadmap.

**Next Steps:**
- Standardize metrics port documentation (8081 vs 9091) across all features.
- Continue populating documentation for other "Implemented" features if missing.
