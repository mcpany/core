# QA Audit Report - 2025-12-19

**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Scope:** Random selection of 5 documentation files.

## 1. Audited Documents

1.  `docs/reference/configuration.md`
2.  `docs/features/kafka.md`
3.  `docs/features/health-checks.md`
4.  `docs/features/audit_logging.md`
5.  `docs/developer_guide.md`

## 2. Step-by-Step Verification

| Document | Step/Feature | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/reference/configuration.md` | `GlobalSettings` fields | **Discrepancy Found** | `mcp_basepath` is reserved in `config.proto` but present in doc. |
| `docs/reference/configuration.md` | `UpstreamServiceConfig` | Verified | Fields match `upstream_service.proto`. |
| `docs/features/kafka.md` | Kafka Message Bus Config | Verified | Matches `proto/bus/bus.proto` and `pkg/bus/kafka/kafka.go`. |
| `docs/features/health-checks.md` | HTTP/Websocket/gRPC Check fields | Verified | Matches `proto/config/v1/health_check.proto`. (Initial check raised false alarm, re-verified correct). |
| `docs/features/audit_logging.md` | Audit Config & Logic | Verified | Matches `pkg/middleware/audit.go` logic (including stdout fallback). |
| `docs/developer_guide.md` | YAML Configuration Examples | **Discrepancy Found** | Examples used camelCase and incorrect structures (lists instead of maps for `calls`) incompatible with `protojson`. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation

*   **`docs/reference/configuration.md`**: Removed `mcp_basepath` from `GlobalSettings` table and example.
*   **`docs/developer_guide.md`**: Rewrote YAML examples to use snake_case keys (e.g., `upstream_services`, `http_service`), correct map structures for `calls`, and correct field names for authentication (`upstream_authentication`, `header_name`, `plain_text`).

### Code Remediation

*   No code changes were required as the discrepancies were in the documentation not reflecting the current code state.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

*   **Kafka Support**: The verified `docs/features/kafka.md` describes Kafka as an internal Message Bus. The Roadmap ("High Priority") requests "Kafka Transport" (likely Upstream Service). This represents a feature gap, but the current documentation accurately describes the *existing* Message Bus feature.
*   **Developer Experience**: The fixes to `docs/developer_guide.md` directly improve the Developer Experience (DX), aligning with the "Codebase Health" goals by ensuring new contributors start with working examples.

## 5. Security Certification

*   This report has been scrubbed of all sensitive information.
*   No API keys, secrets, or PII are included.
