# QA Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)
**Scope:** Documentation Audit & System Integrity Verification

## 1. Audited Documents

| Document | Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Alerts & Incidents | Active (Partial) |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Traffic Inspector & Replay | Beta (Connected) |

## 2. Verification Results

### A. Alerts & Incidents (`docs/alerts-feature.md`)

| Verification Step | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend API** | `GET /api/v1/alerts` exists | Confirmed in `server/pkg/app/api_alerts.go` and `server/pkg/app/api.go` | ✅ Pass |
| **Frontend UI** | `AlertsPage` and `AlertList` exist | Confirmed in `ui/src/app/alerts/page.tsx` | ✅ Pass |
| **Rule Prototype** | `CreateRuleDialog` exists as prototype | Confirmed in `ui/src/components/alerts/create-rule-dialog.tsx` | ✅ Pass |
| **Data Flow** | Frontend fetches from API | Confirmed `AlertList` calls `/api/v1/alerts` | ✅ Pass |

### B. Traffic Inspector (`docs/traces-feature.md`)

| Verification Step | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Source** | `/debug/entries` endpoint exists | Confirmed in `server/pkg/app/server.go` | ✅ Pass |
| **Frontend Adapter** | Transformation logic exists | Confirmed in `ui/src/app/api/traces/route.ts` (BFF Pattern) | ✅ Pass |
| **Replay Action** | "Replay in Playground" button | Confirmed in `ui/src/components/traces/trace-detail.tsx` | ✅ Pass |
| **Visualization** | Waterfall CSS implementation | Confirmed in `trace-detail.tsx` (`WaterfallItem`) | ✅ Pass |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation
- **`docs/alerts-feature.md`**:
    - Added explicit **Code Location** section referencing `server/pkg/alerts/manager.go` and `ui/src/app/alerts/page.tsx`.
    - Clarified that `CreateRuleDialog` is a UI prototype with no backend persistence.
- **`docs/traces-feature.md`**:
    - Added **Code Location** section referencing `server/pkg/middleware/debugger.go` and `ui/src/app/api/traces/route.ts`.
    - Clarified the data transformation role of the Next.js API route (`route.ts`).
    - Added **Roadmap Alignment** reference to "Interactive Tool Usage History".

### Code Remediation
- No code changes were required as the implementation matches the "Partial" and "Beta" statuses described in the documentation and roadmap. The "missing" features (Rules persistence) are correctly identified as Roadmap items or Prototypes.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

- **Alerts**: Aligns with the "Observability Dashboard" roadmap item. The "Rule Management" gap is acknowledged and documented as a future capability.
- **Traces**: Aligns with "Interactive Tool Usage History" (Completed) and "WebSocket Message Inspector" (Related). The feature is functional and connected to the backend.

## 5. Security Note
- Reports checked for sensitive data. No API keys or PII included in this audit.
