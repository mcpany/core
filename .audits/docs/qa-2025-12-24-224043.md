# QA Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Auditor**: Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Scope of Audit

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for verification:
1.  `docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md`
2.  `docs/features/admin_api.md`
3.  `docs/features/policies.md`
4.  `docs/features/web_ui.md`
5.  `docs/features/auth.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Step/Claim | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md` | "MetricsOverview", "ServiceHealthWidget" components exist. | **Pass** | Verified components in `ui/src/components/dashboard/`. |
| `docs/UI_OVERHAUL.md` | Middleware Pipeline visualization. | **Pass** | Verified `ui/src/app/middleware/page.tsx` implements the visualization (mocked). |
| `docs/features/admin_api.md` | Claims `POST /v1/services/register`. | **Pass** | Verified in `proto/api/v1/registration.proto` and `server/pkg/app/server.go`. |
| `docs/features/admin_api.md` | Complete API Documentation. | **Incomplete** | Missing documentation for the RESTful `/api/v1/services` endpoints found in `server/pkg/app/api.go`. |
| `docs/features/policies.md` | Policies: Caching, Rate Limiting, Resilience. | **Pass** | Verified middleware in `server/pkg/middleware/` and resilience in `server/pkg/resilience/`. |
| `docs/features/web_ui.md` | "Interactive Playground... (Coming Soon)". | **Pass** | `ui/src/app/playground/` exists with prototype/mock implementation. |
| `docs/features/auth.md` | RBAC Middleware and `ContextWithRoles`. | **Pass** | Verified `server/pkg/middleware/rbac.go` and usage in `server/pkg/app/server.go`. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation
*   **`docs/features/admin_api.md`**: Significantly expanded to include the RESTful Configuration API (`/api/v1/services`) which supports standard CRUD operations. Clarified the existence of the gRPC/gRPC-Gateway Registration API.
*   **`docs/features/web_ui.md`**: Updated the status of the Interactive Playground to reflect that a prototype is available but operates with simulated responses.

### Code Remediation
*   No code changes were required as the discrepancies were primarily documentation gaps rather than missing features required by the Roadmap. The Roadmap item "Dynamic Web UI (Beta)" is satisfied by the current state of the UI (Dashboard, Services, Middleware, and Playground Prototype).

## 4. Roadmap Alignment
*   **Admin Management API**: Implemented and now better documented.
*   **Dynamic Web UI (Beta)**: Implemented. The Playground is in a prototype state, which fits "Beta" status.
*   **Policies**: Core policies (Caching, Rate Limiting, Resilience) are implemented.

## 5. Security Notes
*   Report scrubbed of sensitive data.
*   No API keys or secrets were exposed in this report.
