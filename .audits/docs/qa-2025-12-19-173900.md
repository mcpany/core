## Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
- **Updated `product-evolution-plan.md`**: Moved "Kafka Transport" from "High Priority" (Future) to "Implemented Features". Removed it from the "Top 10 Recommended Features" table as it is now completed.

### Code Implementations
- No code changes were required as the audited features were found to be implemented.

## Roadmap Alignment Notes
- **Kafka Transport**: The roadmap was outdated regarding Kafka support. The feature is implemented and available for use.
- **Admin API**: Confirmed that `pkg/admin` is skeletal as stated in the Roadmap. This remains a valid roadmap item.
- **Rate Limiting**: Documentation and code are aligned.
