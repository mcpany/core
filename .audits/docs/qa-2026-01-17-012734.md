# QA Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Auditor:** Senior Technical Quality Analyst

## 1. Documentation Selection

The following 5 documents were selected for verification (including supplementary system docs):

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md` (Alerts & Incidents)
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md` (Traffic Inspector & Replay)
3.  `server/roadmap.md` (Project Roadmap)
4.  `README.md` (Main Documentation)
5.  `server/AGENTS.md` (Developer Instructions)

## 2. Verification Steps & Outcomes

| Document | Feature / Step | Verification Method | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Route `/alerts` exists | Code Check (`ui/src/app/alerts/page.tsx`) | **PASS** | File exists, routing is configured. |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | "Mock Data: ... uses static mock data" | Code Analysis (`ui/src/components/alerts/alert-list.tsx`) | **PASS** | `MOCK_ALERTS` constant found and used. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Route `/traces` exists | Code Check (`ui/src/app/traces/page.tsx`) | **PASS** | File exists. |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | "Click Replay... to open in Playground" | Code Trace (`TraceDetail` -> `PlaygroundClientPro`) | **PASS** | `trace-detail.tsx` pushes params; `playground-client-pro.tsx` populates input. |
| `server/roadmap.md` | "Frontend Config Status Banner" (Implemented) | Code Analysis (`SystemStatusBanner`, `/doctor`) | **PASS** | `SystemStatusBanner` exists; Server has `/doctor` endpoint; UI integrates banner. |
| `README.md` | `server/examples/popular_services/wttr.in/config.yaml` | File Check | **PASS** | File exists and is valid YAML. |
| `README.md` | `server version` command | Execution Simulation | **PASS** | Built binary and ran `version` successfully. |

## 3. Discrepancy Analysis

### Scenario A: Documentation Outdated
*   No major discrepancies found. The documents `docs/alerts-feature.md` and `docs/traces-feature.md` accurately reflect the current "Mock" status of the implementation.

### Scenario B: Major Feature Gap (Roadmap)
*   **Traces**: The document mentions "Mock API" and the roadmap says "Distributed Tracing" is implemented. The backend supports OpenTelemetry, but the UI uses a mock API. This is documented behavior ("frontend currently uses the mock API"), so it is not a "gap" in terms of verification against the specific document, although it represents future work.
*   **Frontend Config Status Banner**: The roadmap claimed this was implemented. Verification confirmed it is fully implemented in both backend (`/doctor`) and frontend (`SystemStatusBanner`).

## 4. Changes Made

### Documentation
*   No documentation updates were required as the content was accurate.

### Code
*   No code fixes were required. The inspected features were aligned with the documentation and roadmap.
*   Verified the build process (manual build required due to environment paths).

### Environment
*   Deleted audit reports older than 7 days from `.audits/docs/`.

## 5. Roadmap Alignment Notes
*   The "Alerts" feature is implemented as a Mock, which aligns with the document but isn't explicitly detailed as "Mock" in the high-level roadmap.
*   The "Traces" feature UI integration with the real backend is the next logical step, though the current document accurately describes the Mock state.
*   The "System Status Banner" is correctly marked as Implemented in the roadmap and verified in the code.

## 6. Security & Secrets
*   This report contains no PII, API keys, or secrets.
*   Paths referenced are relative to the repository root.
