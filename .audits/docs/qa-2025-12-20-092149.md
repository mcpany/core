# QA Audit Report - 2025-12-20

**Auditor:** Jules (AI Agent)
**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Scope:** Documentation Audit & Roadmap Alignment

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected and verified:

1.  `server/docs/features/admin_api.md`
2.  `server/docs/features/health-checks.md`
3.  `server/docs/features/audit_logging.md`
4.  `server/docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md`
5.  `server/docs/features/caching/README.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Status | Verification Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `admin_api.md` | **UPDATED** | Document described `List` and `Get` but Roadmap required full CRUD. Code was missing `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`. **Implemented missing features and updated documentation.** |
| `health-checks.md` | **VERIFIED** | Confirmed implementation of HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, CommandLine, and WebRTC health checks in `pkg/upstream` and `proto`. |
| `audit_logging.md` | **VERIFIED** | Confirmed `AuditMiddleware` implementation in `pkg/middleware/audit.go` and configuration in `proto`. |
| `rate-limiting/README.md` | **VERIFIED** | Confirmed Memory and Redis rate limiting implementation in `pkg/middleware/ratelimit*.go`. |
| `caching/README.md` | **VERIFIED** | Confirmed `CachingMiddleware` implementation in `pkg/middleware/cache.go`. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation
-   **`server/docs/features/admin_api.md`**: Updated to include documentation for new `CreateService`, `UpdateService`, and `DeleteService` endpoints.

### Codebase (Roadmap Remediation)
-   **Admin API Expansion**: Implemented `CreateService`, `UpdateService`, and `DeleteService` RPCs in `server/pkg/admin/server.go` and `proto/admin/v1/admin.proto`.
-   **Integration**: Wired the Admin Server to the `EventBus` in `server/pkg/app/server.go` to allow dynamic service registration/unregistration via `ServiceRegistrationWorker`.
-   **Testing**: Added unit tests for new Admin API endpoints in `server/pkg/admin/server_test.go`.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

-   **Admin Management API (Rank 3)**: Successfully addressed the "Skeletal Admin API" issue identified in the Roadmap. The Admin API now supports full CRUD operations, enabling the development of the "Dynamic Web UI" (Rank 4).

## 5. Security & Sensitive Data

-   No sensitive data (keys, secrets, PII) was found in the audited documents or the generated report.
-   Code changes utilize existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Status:** PASS
