# QA Audit Report: Documentation & Feature Verification

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## Scope

- **Directory:** `docs/`
- **Methodology:** Random selection, Step-by-Step Verification, Roadmap Alignment.

## 1. Documents Audited

1.  `docs/alerts-feature.md`
2.  `docs/traces-feature.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Feature | Verification Steps | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/alerts-feature.md` | Alerts & Incidents | 1. Access `/alerts` route.<br>2. Verify dashboard stats.<br>3. Check mock alert list.<br>4. Verify "Create Rule" dialog exists. | **PASS**. Feature is implemented in frontend with mock data as described. UI matches description. | [Screenshot](images/alerts_feature.png) |
| `docs/traces-feature.md` | Traffic Inspector | 1. Access `/traces` route.<br>2. Verify trace list loads.<br>3. Check details view.<br>4. Verify mock API usage. | **PASS**. Feature is implemented in frontend using mock API. UI matches description. | [Screenshot](images/traces_feature.png) |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Remediation
- **`docs/alerts-feature.md`**: Updated screenshot reference to a newly generated verification image (`images/alerts_feature.png`). Confirmed "Implemented" status aligns with current frontend-mock state.
- **`docs/traces-feature.md`**: Updated screenshot reference to `images/traces_feature.png` and generated new screenshot. Confirmed consistency with codebase. Deleted orphaned `trace_view.png`.

### Code Remediation
- No major code fixes were required. The codebase aligns with the current roadmap phase (Frontend Demos with Mock Data).
- **Note**: The Server Roadmap lists "Distributed Tracing" as implemented, while the Frontend uses a Mock API. This is a known transitional state documented in `traces-feature.md`.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Notes

- **Alerts Feature**: Not explicitly on the Server Roadmap's immediate "Top 10", but part of the completed "Observability Dashboard" in UI Roadmap. Current mock implementation is sufficient for the current phase.
- **Traces Feature**: Server supports OpenTelemetry, but UI uses Mock API. This allows for frontend development independent of backend integration. Future work should connect `ui/src/app/api/traces` to the real backend.

## 5. Security & Hygiene
- Previous audit reports older than 7 days were cleaned up.
- Report scrubbed of sensitive data.
