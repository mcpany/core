# Documentation Audit Report
Date: 2025-12-19
Time: 22:39:05 UTC

## Executive Summary
This report details the findings of a random documentation audit performed on the MCP Any codebase. Five documents were selected and verified against the current system state. Discrepancies were noted and remediated where applicable.

## Audited Documents

1.  `docs/features/kafka.md`
2.  `docs/features/security.md`
3.  `docs/features/audit_logging.md`
4.  `docs/reference/configuration.md`
5.  `docs/developer_guide.md`

## Verification Table

| Document | Step/Feature Verified | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/features/kafka.md` | Kafka Message Bus Configuration | Verified | `pkg/bus/kafka` implementation exists and matches `global_settings` config structure in `proto/config/v1/config.proto`. |
| `docs/features/security.md` | Secrets Management (Vault, AWS) | Verified | `pkg/util/secrets.go` implements `ResolveSecret` covering all providers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) as described. |
| `docs/features/audit_logging.md` | Audit Logging Middleware | Verified | `pkg/middleware/audit.go` implements the logging logic with configurable fields (`log_arguments`, `log_results`) matching documentation. |
| `docs/reference/configuration.md` | Command Line Service Config | Verified | `CommandLineUpstreamService` in `proto/config/v1/upstream_service.proto` and `pkg/upstream/command/command.go` implementation match the reference. |
| `docs/developer_guide.md` | Makefile Commands | **Discrepancy Found** | Document listed `make proto-gen`, but Makefile defines `make gen`. |

## Changes Made

### Documentation Edits
-   **`docs/developer_guide.md`**: Corrected the Makefile command reference from `make proto-gen` to `make gen`.

### Code Remediation
-   No code changes were required as the code implementation for the audited features (Kafka, Security, Audit Logging, Command Line Service) was found to be consistent with the documentation.

## Roadmap Alignment Notes

-   **Kafka Integration**: The audit confirmed that Kafka support is fully implemented and documented (`docs/features/kafka.md`), despite the **Product Evolution Plan** listing it as a "High Priority (Next 1-3 Months)" feature (Rank 5). This suggests the Roadmap document is outdated regarding this feature's status.
-   **Security & Audit**: Core security features (Secrets, Audit Logging) are implemented and aligned with the Roadmap's emphasis on Enterprise Readiness.

## Security Declaration
This report has been scrubbed of all sensitive information, PII, and API keys.
