# Documentation Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Auditor:** Jules (Senior Technical Quality Analyst)

## 1. Audited Documents

The following 5 documents were randomly selected for verification:
1. `docs/features/audit_logging.md`
2. `docs/reference/configuration.md`
3. `docs/features/security.md`
4. `docs/features/nats.md`
5. `docs/features/rate-limiting/README.md`

## 2. Verification Results

| Document | Step / Claim | Outcome | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `audit_logging.md` | `GlobalSettings` has `audit` config; `AuditMiddleware` exists | Verified | `proto/config/v1/config.proto` defines `AuditConfig`. `pkg/middleware/audit.go` implements logic. |
| `configuration.md` | `McpAnyServerConfig` structure and fields | Verified | Matches `proto/config/v1/config.proto`. |
| `security.md` | IP Allowlisting (`allowed_ips`) | Verified | `pkg/app/server.go` implements IP allowlisting middleware. |
| `nats.md` | NATS integration via `message_bus` | Verified | `proto/bus/bus.proto` defines `NatsBus`. `pkg/bus/nats/nats.go` implements it. |
| `rate-limiting/README.md` | Redis support for rate limiting | Verified | `proto/config/v1/upstream_service.proto` defines `STORAGE_REDIS`. `pkg/middleware/ratelimit_redis.go` implements it. |

## 3. Changes Made

### Documentation Updates
- **`docs/roadmap.md`**: Updated "High Priority" list to remove "Distributed Rate Limiting (Redis)" as it is already implemented. Updated "Implemented Features" to clarify Redis support for Rate Limiting.
- **`product-evolution-plan.md`**: Updated "Implemented Features" to include "Distributed Rate Limiting (Redis)", "Runtime Argument Validation", and "Audit Logging". Removed these from "High Priority" and "Recommended Features" lists.

### Code Remediation
- No code changes were required as the audited features were found to be fully implemented. The discrepancy was in the Roadmap documents claiming these features were missing.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment

- **Distributed Rate Limiting (Redis)**: Documented in Roadmap as missing/high priority, but found to be fully implemented. Roadmap updated to reflect reality.
- **Audit Logging**: Documented in Roadmap as missing, but found to be implemented. Roadmap updated.
- **Runtime Argument Validation**: Documented in Roadmap as missing, but found to be implemented via Policy Hooks. Roadmap updated.
