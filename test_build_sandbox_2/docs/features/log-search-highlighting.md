# Log Search Highlighting

The **Log Search Highlighting** feature enhances the debuggability of the MCP Any Admin Console by visually emphasizing search terms within the Live Logs stream.

## Overview

When filtering logs using the search bar, any matching text within the log message or the source component name is highlighted in yellow. This allows users to quickly scan the log stream and locate relevant information.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the **Live Logs** page.
2.  Enter a term in the **Search** input field (e.g., "error", "timeout", "http").
3.  The log stream will automatically filter to show only matching logs.
4.  Matches within the visible logs will be highlighted.
