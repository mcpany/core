- [x] **Saved Tool Arguments**: Ability to save a set of arguments as a "Preset" for a tool in the Playground, to quickly test different scenarios.
- [x] **Tool Execution History Persisted**: Persist the local history of tool executions in `localStorage` or backend, so it survives page reloads.
- [x] **Tool Execution Duration Tracking**: Display the execution time (latency) for each tool call in the Playground history.

- [x] **Tool Output Diffing**: When re-running a tool with same args, show a diff of the output if it changed.
- [x] **Context Usage Estimator**: Calculate and display estimated token usage for each tool/service to prevent context bloat (Address "MCP servers eat context" pain point).
- [x] **Sensitive Data Detection**: Warning when configuring services that might expose sensitive environment variables (e.g. AWS_SECRET_KEY) in tools.
- [x] **Preset Sharable URL**: Generate a link to the playground with pre-filled arguments (using presets or query params) to easily share configurations with team members.
- [ ] **Preset Cloud Sync**: Sync saved tool presets to the backend (user profile) so they persist across devices and browser sessions.
- [ ] **Robust Mocking Strategy**: Extend the mocking strategy used in Settings E2E tests to other critical E2E flows (Services, Tools) to reduce CI flakiness.
