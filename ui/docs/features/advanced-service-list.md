# Advanced Service List

The Service List has been enhanced with advanced management features to help users manage large numbers of services efficiently.

## Features

### Sorting
You can now sort the service list by clicking on the column headers.
- **Name**: Alphabetical sort.
- **Type**: Sort by service type (HTTP, gRPC, CLI, MCP).
- **Version**: Alphanumeric sort.
- **Secure**: Sort by security status (TLS enabled/disabled).

Clicking a header toggles between Ascending and Descending order.

### Density Control
A new "Density Toggle" button in the toolbar allows you to switch between:
- **Default View**: Comfortable spacing for easier reading.
- **Compact View**: Reduced padding to fit more services on the screen.

### Bulk Actions
Select multiple services using the checkboxes to perform bulk operations:
- **Enable**: Enable all selected services.
- **Disable**: Disable all selected services.
- **Bulk Edit**: Update tags for all selected services.
- **Delete**: Remove all selected services.
