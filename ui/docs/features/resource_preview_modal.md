# Resource Preview Modal

The Resource Preview Modal provides a large, focused view for inspecting resource content. This is particularly useful for viewing large JSON files, lengthy text documents, complex configurations, or binary assets (images) that are difficult to view in the split-pane view.

## Features

- **Maximize View**: Click the expand icon in the resource explorer to open the content in a large modal.
- **Context Menu Access**: Right-click any resource in the list and select "Preview in Modal".
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports JSON, YAML, XML, Markdown, and plain text with automatic syntax highlighting.
- **Binary Preview**: Native support for previewing images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and other binary content types.
- **Actions**:
    - **Copy Content**: Quickly copy the resource text to your clipboard.
    - **Download**: Download the resource content as a file.
    - **Refresh**: Reload the content from the server.
