# Stacks Management

The **Stacks Management** feature allows you to group multiple services into logical units called "Stacks". This enables a "Portainer-like" experience where you can manage, configure, and deploy entire environments or application sets together.

## Features

- **Create Stacks**: Define new stacks with a name and description.
- **Manage Services**: Add and configure services within a stack using the integrated YAML editor.
- **Local Storage**: Stacks are currently stored locally in your browser, allowing you to draft configurations without affecting the backend immediately.
- **Visual Editor**: Visualize your stack topology and edit configurations with syntax highlighting and validation.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the **Stacks** page from the sidebar.
2.  Click **Create Stack** to start a new collection.
3.  Click on a stack card to open the **Stack Editor**.
4.  Use the editor to define your services in YAML format. You can drag and drop templates from the palette.
5.  Click **Save Changes** to persist your configuration.
