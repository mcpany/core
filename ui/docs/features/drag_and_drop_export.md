# Drag-and-Drop Resource Export

MCP Any now supports dragging resources directly from the UI to your desktop or other applications.

## How it works

1. Navigate to the **Resources** page.
2. Select a resource to view its content.
3. Once the content is loaded, a **File Icon** appears in the preview header.
4. **Drag and Drop** this icon (or the resource row in the list if selected) to your desktop.
5. The file will be saved with the appropriate name and extension.
