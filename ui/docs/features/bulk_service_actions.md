# Bulk Service Actions

The Service Management page now supports bulk actions, allowing you to manage multiple services simultaneously. This brings MCP Any closer to a full-featured management console like Portainer.

## Features

- **Multi-Select**: Select multiple services using the checkboxes in the service list.
- **Select All**: Select all filtered services with a single click.
- **Bulk Enable/Disable**: Quickly toggle the status of multiple services.
- **Bulk Delete**: Unregister multiple services at once.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the **Services** page.
2. Click the checkbox next to the services you want to manage, or click the checkbox in the table header to select all.
3. A toolbar will appear above the table showing the number of selected services.
4. Click **Enable**, **Disable**, or **Delete** to perform the action on all selected services.
