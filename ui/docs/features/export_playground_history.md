# Export Playground History

The **Export Playground History** feature allows users to save their current session's tool execution history to a JSON file. This is useful for debugging, sharing reproduction steps, or keeping a record of interactions.

## How to use

1. Navigate to the **Playground** (or Console).
2. Execute some tools.
3. Click the **Export** button in the header (next to "Clear").
4. A JSON file named `mcp-playground-history-YYYY-MM-DD.json` will be downloaded.
