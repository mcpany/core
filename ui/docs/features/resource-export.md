# Resource Export

## Overview
The Resource Export feature allows users to easily export resources from MCP Any to their local machine or other applications.

## Features

### Drag-and-Drop to Desktop
Users can drag a resource from the preview pane directly to their desktop or file system explorer to save it as a file. This is supported in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc).

### Download Button
A "Download" button is available in the resource preview header. This button allows users to download the resource content as a file. The filename is automatically derived from the resource name or URI.

### Context Menu Download
Users can also right-click on any resource in the list (even if not currently selected) and choose "Download" from the context menu. This will fetch the resource content (if not already loaded) and trigger the download.
