# Playground File Upload Enhancements

## Overview

The Playground's file upload capability has been enhanced with Drag-and-Drop support and Image Previews, providing a more seamless and intuitive experience for working with file inputs.

## Key Features

-   **Drag-and-Drop**: Users can now drag and drop files directly onto the input area.
-   **Image Preview**: When an image file is selected or dropped, a preview thumbnail is displayed instantly.
-   **Visual Feedback**: The drop zone highlights when dragging a file over it.

## How it works

1.  **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag a file from your operating system and drop it onto the "Click or drag file to upload" area.
2.  **Preview**: If the file is an image (based on MIME type), a preview will appear replacing the upload icon.
3.  **Clear**: Hover over the filename to clear the selection.
